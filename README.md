# Mapeo Config Editor

This is a "proof-of-concept" application for testing a very basic way of editing Mapeo configurations.

## Configuring Netlify

First you'll need to create your own fork of this project. It's a good naming convention to name the repo with the name of the territory where the config will be used. Ex.: `mapeo-config-kalunga`

Then modify the `src/config.js` file with your own fork of this project.

## Usage

Install with `npm i` and then run it with `npm start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
